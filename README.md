## Problem Background
### Introduction
The Problem: The Road Warrior  
A new startup wants to build the next generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations. Organized by trip either online (web) or through their mobile device.  
### Requirements
- Poll email looking for travel-related emails,  
- Filter and whitelist certain emails,  
- The system must interface with the agencyâ€™s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.). Updates must be in the app within 5 minutes of an update (better than the competition),  
- Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well,  
- Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard,  
- Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip,  
- Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms,  
- Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel usage,  
- Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users trips for various purposes - travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on,  
### Additional Context
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems (i.e, SABRE, APOLLO),  
- Must integrate with preferred travel agency for quick problem resolution (help me!)
- Must work internationally technical requirements,
### Technical Requirements
- Users must be able to access the system at all times (max 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime),  
- Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source,  
- Response time from web (800ms) and mobile (First-contentful paint of under 1.4 sec) 

Users  
- 2 million active users/week, 
- total users: 15 million (user accounts)  

## Strategy and Vision

### Vision
In order to make the Business Case viable profit-wise, the Road Warrior Service is provided for free and the income is generated by selling the (anonymized) analytical data from user trips and items. Providing this data to the travel agencies will give them better insight into market shifts and customer preferences and provide services in line with those opportunities.  

Our professional expertise is in the Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) domain. It means that factors such as energy consumption, climate, availability of raw materials, health, safety and good corporate governance are taken into account when selecting and managing shareholdings in companies.  

ESG is all about seeking a balance between financial and economic results, transparency, social interests and the environment without losing the balance between them. Contrary to popular belief, this balance appears to lead to better results for both the company and society. There is a broad consensus that ESG objectives ultimately create added value for portfolio companies, both from the perspective of risk mitigation and value creation.  

Incorporating ESG into Road Warrior gives it an edge in the Global market.  

We strive to use SaaS components and/or re-use components when it makes sense to do so.  

### Goals
- Achieve clear insight of all your trips and items within a single dashboard view.  
- To provide ESG data to external partners to provide additional value aside from the travel analytical data.  
- To use SaaS solutions when it is applicable in the Architecture.  

### Opportunities
- Use and re-use components when applicable in the Architecture.  
- Use our niche in the market to supply travel agencies with ESG valued data.  
- Further provide reports on travel trends, based on your location, occupation, travel type (business/private).  

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Assumptions
|ID|Name|Description|
|-|-|-|
|1.|Profit goal|Road Warrior service is provided for free, income generated by selling the analytical data from user trips.|
|2.|Travel Agancy|Road Warrior service is not a travel agency system, but an aggregator of user travel data from multiple sources. Because of that no reservations can be made over the Road Warrior UI or API.|
|3.|Standardized interfaces|Data sources have standardized APIs where travel systems cover a majority of service providers in different categories, but along that major service chains (like SIXT for car rental or Marriott for hotels) may have their own APIs.|
|4.|Webhooks|Standardized APIs of data sources are capable of providing webhooks methods for subscribing to asynchronous data feeds.|
|5.|Data from sources|A single source (travel agencies, travel systems, airlines, etc.) always provides new information and do not duplicate its own updates.|
|6.|Mobile apps|Mobile apps are native, not web based.|
|7.|Email Polling|Email polling is supported only with major email service providers, e.g. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft. Otherwise users will need to relay on email forwarding based on filtering.|

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Cloud Deployment 

In today's digital age, the deployment of a sophisticated application requires more than just hosting it on a server. It demands a comprehensive approach where different components of the system integrate seamlessly, scale as per demand, and remain resilient to failures. "The Road Warrior" isn't just an application; it's an intricate ecosystem of interrelated services aimed at simplifying the traveler's experience.

Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, offers a vast array of services tailored to cater to such sophisticated systems. From databases that store crucial user data to compute resources that run the core application, Azure provides tools that can be pieced together to build robust, scalable, and efficient systems.

For "The Road Warrior", Azure isn't just a host but a foundation. Leveraging Azure's capabilities, the system aims to provide users with real-time travel updates, ensure data security, and deliver a seamless user experience, whether accessed from a desktop in New York or a mobile device in Tokyo. The deployment model for "The Road Warrior" on Azure encapsulates this vision, laying out a blueprint of how each component of the system is set up, interacts, and scales to serve huge number of travelers worldwide.

### DevOps Pipeline

Modern software development has evolved beyond simple code writing and deployment. Today's applications, especially complex ones like "The Road Warrior", require a streamlined process that merges the traditionally separate disciplines of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). This merged approach is termed as "DevOps".

The essence of DevOps is to automate and enhance the software delivery process, ensuring rapid, reliable, and consistent deployments. It transforms the entire software life cycle, from code writing to deployment and monitoring.

Azure DevOps Services, offered by Microsoft, provides a suite of cloud-based tools that support the entire DevOps life cycle. From version control with Azure Repos, to build and release automation with Azure Pipelines, and work tracking with Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Services facilitate a seamless flow of code from development to production.

Implementing a DevOps pipeline using Azure means leveraging these tools to ensure that the travel dashboard remains agile, reliable, and consistently updated with the latest features, while minimizing downtime and errors. Through a series of automated stages, the code is integrated, tested, deployed, and monitored, allowing developers and operations teams to collaborate effectively and deliver the best experience for the users.

#### Source Control:
Start by setting up a repository in Azure Repos. You can use Git for version control.
Organize your codebase with separate branches for features, development, staging, and production.

#### Continuous Integration (CI):
Upon every code commit or pull request merge, trigger a build process.
Use Azure Pipelines to set up the CI process.
The CI process usually involves:
Fetching the latest code.
Running unit tests.
Compiling the code.
Packaging the compiled code into deployable units (like Docker containers).
Storing the deployable units in a repository, such as Azure Container Registry for Docker images.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD):
This phase is also set up using Azure Pipelines.
The CD process is triggered after a successful CI process or manually when you're ready to deploy.
Steps often include:
Fetching the deployable units from the repository.
Deploying them to a staging environment using tools like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or directly to Azure App Service.
Running integration and UI tests.
If tests pass, the same deployable units are promoted to the production environment.

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or tools like Terraform, define the infrastructure needed for your application.
This ensures that the infrastructure can be provisioned and managed reliably and consistently.

#### Configuration Management:
Use tools like Azure Key Vault to manage secrets and configurations without exposing them in the codebase.
This ensures that sensitive data is kept secure, and configurations can be changed without altering code.

#### Monitoring & Logging:
Once deployed, use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to gather telemetry data, logs, and set up alerts for any anomalies.
This helps in identifying issues in real time and facilitates rapid response.

#### Feedback & Iteration:
Gather feedback from the staging and production environments.
Use tools like Azure Application Insights for performance monitoring and user analytics.
Incorporate the feedback into the next development cycle, promoting a continuous feedback loop.

#### Collaboration & Communication:
Use Azure Boards for work tracking, including features, bugs, and user stories.
Ensure that the development and operations teams communicate effectively, using tools like Microsoft Teams or Slack, which can be integrated into Azure DevOps for notifications and alerts.

### Database Replication Consideration

The latency for replicating a specific table or dataset between different regions in a cloud environment, like Azure, depends on multiple factors:
- Database Type and Service: Azure offers several types of databases, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL, and others. Each of these databases has its own replication mechanisms and associated latencies.
- Network Latency: This depends on the distance and network route between the source and target regions.
- Data Volume: The amount of data being replicated can impact latency, especially during the initial replication.
- Transaction Volume: If the database is under heavy use, replication might be slower due to the increased transaction volume.
- Database Configuration: The configuration of the database, including indexes, triggers, and other settings, can influence replication latency.
- Service Level Agreement (SLA): Azure typically provides SLAs for many of its services, which can give you an idea of expected performance.

- Azure Cosmos DB has a multi-master model that allows for low-latency writes in multiple regions. It promises single-digit millisecond latencies for reads and writes.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally

- Azure SQL Database Geo-Replication provides a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 5 seconds for 99% of the time. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/active-geo-replication-overview?view=azuresql)

#### Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB promises single-digit millisecond read and write latencies at the 99th percentile. The actual latency will vary based on the chosen consistency model. Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels: Strong, Bounded staleness, Session, Consistent prefix, and Eventual. Each of these has different implications for latency and data accuracy. Multi-master replication allows for multiple write regions, which can help ensure low-latency writes no matter where the application is deployed.

#### Azure SQL Database Geo-Replication
For Azure SQL Database using Active Geo-Replication, the recovery point objective (RPO) is typically less than 5 seconds for 99% of the time. This means that in the case of a failover, typically lose less than 5 seconds worth of transactions. The recovery time objective (RTO), which is the time it takes to restore after a failure, is typically less than 30 seconds. RPO and RTO are disaster recovery metrics and are not directly measures of replication latency, but they give an idea of how quickly data is synchronized and how fast a failover can complete.
