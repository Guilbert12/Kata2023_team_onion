## 2. Problem Background
### Introduction
The Problem: The Road Warrior  
A new startup wants to build the next generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations. Organized by trip either online (web) or through their mobile device.  
### Requirements
- Poll email looking for travel-related emails,  
- Filter and whitelist certain emails,  
- The system must interface with the agencyâ€™s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.). Updates must be in the app within 5 minutes of an update (better than the competition),  
- Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well,  
- Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard,  
- Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip,  
- Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms,  
- Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel usage,  
- Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users trips for various purposes - travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on,  
### Additional Context
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems (i.e, SABRE, APOLLO),  
- Must integrate with preferred travel agency for quick problem resolution (help me!) must work internationally technical requirements,  
- Users must be able to access the system at all times (max 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime),  
- Travel updates must be presented in the app within 5 minutes of generation by the source,  
- Response time from web (800ms) and mobile,  

Users  
- 2 million active users/week, 
- total users: 15 million (user accounts)  

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Assumptions
|ID|Name|Description|
|-|-|-|
|1.|Profit goal|Road Warrior service is provided for free, income generated by selling the analytical data from user trips.|
|2.|Travel Agancy|Road Warrior service is not a travel agency system, but an aggregator of user travel data from multiple sources. Because of that no reservations can be made over the Road Warrior UI or API.|
|3.|Standardized interfaces|Data sources have standardized APIs where travel systems cover a majority of service providers in different categories, but along that major service chains (like SIXT for car rental or Marriott for hotels) may have their own APIs.|
|4.|Webhooks|Standardized APIs of data sources are capable of providing webhooks methods for subscribing to asynchronous data feeds.|
|5.|Data from sources|A single source (travel agencies, travel systems, airlines, etc.) always provides new information and do not duplicate its own updates.|
|6.|Mobile apps|Mobile apps are native, not web based.|
|7.|Email Polling|Email polling is supported only with major email service providers, e.g. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft. Otherwise users will need to relay on email forwarding based on filtering.|
