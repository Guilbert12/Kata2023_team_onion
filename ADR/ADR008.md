# Architectural Decision Record
## User data store not replicated between regions
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Legal and regulatory compliance: As many countries and regions, where Road Warrior will be available, have enacted strict data protection laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We need to ensure compliance with such legal requirements, avoiding potential legal and financial consequences. 

## Decision
User data will be only kept in his region of origin and not be replicated to the region where he is traveling.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- User data is stored securely and according to regulations that are applicable to his case.
- 

### Negative:
- 

### Risks:
- Interaction with user data related parts of the Road Warrior might have slightly higher latency.

### Risks mitigation:
- Use of caching withing the UI applications and API Management.

### Additional Features:
-
