# Architectural Decision Record
## Data replication over different hosting regions
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## ADR ID
ADR010

## ADR Version
1.0 - 15.09.2023

## Context
The Road Warrior application is required to be available internationally and with low latency, which leads to the need to replicate application data (user data excluded) between different cloud regions to support that requirement. We find that only selective replication is needed based on data available in the application (GPS) or provided by the user (trips, reservations).

## Decision
The application data store will be replicated within one region fully (multi-instance NoSQL DB for frontend), but only on a contextual need between regions based on users current location or planned trips, travel items. 

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Data always where it is needed,
- Data available with a very low latency,

### Negative:
- Creates additional complexity by introducing additional logic to the DB replication mechanisms,

### Risks:
- Operational complexity: managing a multi-region data replication system can be operationally complex. Monitoring replication, diagnosing issues, and ensuring high availability require dedicated efforts.
- Vendor lock-In: depending on the cloud provider or infrastructure services chosen for each region, there is a risk of vendor lock-in, making it challenging to switch providers or migrate between regions.

### Risks mitigation:
- Invest in robust monitoring and observability tools. Implement automated alerts and recovery mechanisms to respond to replication failures promptly. We need to consider managed database services that simplify replication setup and management.
- As vendor lock-in is a concern, we need to consider using open-source or cloud-agnostic replication technologies, or implement abstraction layers to minimize direct dependencies on a specific provider's services.

### Additional Features:
