# Architectural Decision Record
## Data replication over different hosting regions
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## ADR ID
ADR010

## ADR Version
1.0 - 15.09.2023

## Context
The Road Warrior application is required to be available internationally and with low latency, which leads to the need to replicate application data (user data excluded) between different cloud regions to support that requirement. We find that only selective replication is needed based on data available in the application (GPS) or provided by the user (trips, reservations).

## Decision
The application data store will be replicated within one region fully (multi-instance NoSQL DB for frontend), but only on a contextual need between regions based on users current location or planned trips, travel items. 

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Data always where it is needed,
- Data available with a very low latency,

### Negative:
- Creates additional complexity by introducing additional logic to the DB replication mechanisms,

### Risks:
- 

### Risks mitigation:
- 

### Additional Features:
-
