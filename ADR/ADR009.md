# Architectural Decision Record
## Use of caching for common requests to lower latency
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## ADR ID
ADR009

## ADR Version
1.0 - 15.09.2023

## Context
High ammount of users means that there will be an even higher amount of requests made to the application APIs, which in turn presents us with the following challenges: 
- Latency: To display listings and details, the website needs to query the database and perform various data processing tasks, which can introduce latency.
- Database Load: Frequent database queries can put a significant load on the backend database servers, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
- User Experience: Slow response times can frustrate users and lead to cart abandonment, reducing sales.

## Decision
Caching will be used to mitigate potential latancy and performance issues and at the same time improve user experience

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Lower Latency: Caching allows the website to respond quickly to user requests since it can serve frequently accessed data from memory rather than querying the database every time.
- Reduced Database Load: Caching reduces the load on the database servers, ensuring they can handle more requests without performance degradation.
- Improved User Experience: Faster response times lead to a better user experience, increasing the likelihood of completing purchases and reducing cart abandonment.

### Negative:
- 

### Risks:
- Stale data: cached data can become stale if it's not regularly updated to reflect changes in the underlying data source. Stale data can lead to incorrect or outdated results being served to users.
- Cache consistency: maintaining cache consistency in distributed systems with multiple cache nodes can be difficult. Inconsistent caches can result in users seeing different versions of the same data.

### Risks mitigation:
- Implement cache expiration policies and mechanisms to periodically refresh cached data. Consider using cache-invalidation techniques to remove stale data when it becomes outdated.
- Use distributed cache solutions that support consistency mechanisms, such as cache replication or distributed cache coordination protocols.

### Additional Features:
-
