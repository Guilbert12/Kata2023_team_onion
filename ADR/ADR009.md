# Architectural Decision Record
## Use of caching for common requests to lower latency
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## Context
High ammount of users means that there will be an even higher amount of requests made to the application APIs, which in turn presents us with the following challenges: 
Latency: To display listings and details, the website needs to query the database and perform various data processing tasks, which can introduce latency.
Database Load: Frequent database queries can put a significant load on the backend database servers, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
User Experience: Slow response times can frustrate users and lead to cart abandonment, reducing sales.

## Decision
Caching will be used to mitigate potential latancy and performance issues and at the same time improve user experience

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Lower Latency: Caching allows the website to respond quickly to user requests since it can serve frequently accessed data from memory rather than querying the database every time.
- Reduced Database Load: Caching reduces the load on the database servers, ensuring they can handle more requests without performance degradation.
- Improved User Experience: Faster response times lead to a better user experience, increasing the likelihood of completing purchases and reducing cart abandonment.
