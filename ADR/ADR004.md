# Architectural Decision Record
## Use UI specific API groups
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## ADR ID
ADR004

## ADR Version
1.0 - 15.09.2023

## Context
The application needs to be portable between devices like PC, laptop, tablet or mobile. This creates differences between those how data is presented, as well as the scope of data that needs to be presented.

## Decision
Use device type specific API groups representing the same functions with tightly tailored data scopes.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Data sets optimized for device types,
- Modularity introduced by this approach provides easier change to scopes of data,

### Negative:
- This approach increases complexity, maintaining multiple API groups can introduce complexity into the application architecture. Each API group may have its own set of endpoints, data models and logic, which can make the overall system more intricate and challenging to manage.

### Risks:
- Increased complexity: maintaining multiple API groups can introduce complexity into the application architecture. Each API group may have its own set of endpoints, data models and logic, which can make the overall system more intricate and challenging to manage.
- Consistency across UIs: ensuring consistency in data and functionality across different UIs can become a challenge. It's essential to maintain synchronization between UI-specific API groups to prevent discrepancies.
- Managing security across multiple API groups can be challenging, because each API group may require different authentication and authorization mechanisms, increasing the risk of security misconfigurations

### Risks mitigation:
- Implement robust documentation and version control for the APIs to help manage complexity.
- Establish clear guidelines and standards for data consistency and synchronization mechanisms. One could implement automated tests and data validation processes to catch inconsistencies (early).
- Implement strong security practices, i.e. role-based access control, secure communication protocols and regular security audits.

### Additional Features:
-
