# Architectural Decision Record
## Record architecture decisions
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## Context
All architectural decisions made over this project must be recorded in a cohesive, useful and understandable manner.

## Decision
Architecture Decision Records, [as described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), will be used to record our architectural decisions.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Decisions are organized and easy to access,
- It is easy to find the reason for a decision made,
- It is a learning experience to create and use ADRs,

### Negative:
- Everyone on the project need to be familiarized with the concept of ADRs

### Risks:
- Those not familiarized with ADRs may struggle to find them or realize that they exist,

### Risks mitigation:
- ADRs need to be clearly established in the main document,

### Additional Features:
- This format may be later reused for othe projects to improve governance over our architecture and decision making processes,
