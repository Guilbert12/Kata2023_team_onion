# Architectural Decision Record
## Web Content Accessibility Guidlines
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## ADR ID
ADR011

## ADR Version
1.0 - 15.09.2023

## Context
Accessibility in software architecture is of paramount importance because it ensures that software and digital products are usable by individuals with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. This inclusivity is not just a legal or ethical requirement; it also makes good business sense, as it broadens your user base and ensures that your software is usable by as many people as possible.

## Decision
We are going to adhere to recommendations provided by [WCAG2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Inclusivity and Equal Access: Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can use your software effectively. This aligns with the principles of equal access and inclusivity, promoting diversity and user engagement.
- Legal Compliance: In many countries, accessibility is legally mandated. Failure to comply with accessibility standards can result in legal issues and penalties. Adhering to accessibility guidelines from the start can save both time and resources in addressing compliance issues later.
- Market Expansion: By making your software accessible, you can reach a broader audience, including people with disabilities. This expanded user base can lead to increased revenue and market share.
- Enhanced User Experience: Accessibility features often benefit all users, not just those with disabilities. For example, text-to-speech functionality can assist users in understanding content in noisy environments or while multitasking.
- Brand Reputation: Demonstrating a commitment to accessibility can enhance your brand's reputation. It shows that your organization values diversity and inclusivity, which can resonate positively with customers and partners.
- Future-Proofing: As technology evolves, accessibility requirements may become more stringent. Designing with accessibility in mind from the start can make it easier to adapt to changing standards and technologies.
- Customer Loyalty: Users who have positive experiences with accessible software are more likely to become loyal customers and advocates for your brand.
- Reduced Support Costs: Accessible software is often easier for users to understand and navigate, leading to fewer support requests. This can result in cost savings and more efficient customer support.
- Compliance with Industry Standards: In some industries, adherence to accessibility standards is a requirement for participating in government contracts or collaborating with other organizations.
- Innovation: Solving accessibility challenges can drive innovation within your development team. Finding creative solutions to make software accessible can lead to new ideas and technologies that benefit a broader range of users.

### Negative:

### Risks:
