# Architectural Decision Record
## Utilization of SaaS solutions for use cases requireing complex systems
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Some use cases may require specialised or complex systems. Building those ourselfs would not be feasible both is time and cost perspective. This should be applied to common services like email, but also to specialized services like push notifications or data analytics. 

## Decision
We will be using SaaS solutions for services that we cannot easily build ourselfs.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Better Time to Market for the MVP,
- Easier onboarding of new staff,
- Part of operational responsibilities moved to a SaaS vendor,

### Negative:
- The solutions might not be customizable enough for future needs,

### Risks:
- Vendor lock might lead to additional licensing costs or future costly migration if dependencies will not be managed. 

### Risks mitigation:
- Observe and manage coupling between major components to mitigate additional costs,

### Additional Features:
-
