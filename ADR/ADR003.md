# Architectural Decision Record
## Use user centric events
Date: 15.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a mechanizsm to transfer data between different components of the application to enable decoupling and proper scaleability of key user related components. Every UI use of Road Warrior application is centered around the user and his experience. Pieces of information provided by the user are triggers to an event within the system to be processed. Data gathering from sources may be done over polling mechanism, which are resource consuming, or by webhooks, which rely on the source to push the information to Road Warrior. 

## Decision
Use user centric events as primary means of distributing data over the system components. These events should represent the current state and use a common language easy to understand by all technical components.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- PubSub model enables a large number of subscriptions to be added in a plug and play manner, promoting scaleability and evolvability,
- Event promote usage of a common language model,
- Fault tolerance and recovery,
- Capability to provide the state of the system in real-time,

### Negative:
- Using PubSub mechanism adds to the complexity of the system,
- Eventual consistency is an approach that may be problematic for developers that are used to a transactional approaches,

### Risks:
- Events may queue up and not be processed when the event subscribers have insufficient resources or instances,

### Risks mitigation:
- Apply data from PubSub monitoring to feed into scaleability mechanisms for event subsribers,

### Additional Features:
-
