# Security Decision Record
## Record architecture decisions
Date: 16.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## SDR ID
SDR003

## SDR Version
1.0 - 16.09.2023

## Context
User registration process must be robust and auditable to ensure a human is using the system and the Road Warrior's terms and conditions are accepted

## Decision
User registration should at least consist of the following steps (this list is not exhaustive)
- Email address validation
- Captcha routine
- Accepting the Road Warriors terms and conditions
- Opt-in for Travel Email Discovery
- Opt-in for Multi Factor Authentication onboarding (strongle advised for each unique device)

## Consequences
This ensures that the Road Warrior is not flooded with non-valid user (bot) data and the user registration process is auditable and secure

### Positive:
- Compliance is guaranteed, no room for doubt if a user has given consent and the user base consists of actual humans

### Negative:
- Users might be deterred of using the Road Warrior if the registration process is complex and not user friendly

### Risks:
- Not reaching the full potential of the Road Warrior if users not registering

### Risks mitigation:
- Monitor the registration process, check in which phase new users stop the process and make improvements where needed
