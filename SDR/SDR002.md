# Security Decision Record
## Data security
Date: 16.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## SDR ID
SDR002

## SDR Version
1.0 - 16.09.2023

## Context
User Data that is processed should be checked for sensitive content which is not in scope of the Road Warrior

## Decision
User Data should be checked for sensitive content before processing or storage to avoid accidental storage of data types that are not in scope of the Road Warrior.
This is important for the Travel Email Discovery as email that is processed consists of formats where email content could contain unstructured data including passport numbers and creditcard information

## Consequences
Add a routine to the Travel Email Discovery logic to recognise number patterns for these types of data and other sensitive data types

### Positive:
Make sure compliance is ensured by checking data before import

### Negative:
Add complexity to the Travel Email Discovery component

### Risks:
The Travel Email Discovery logic discards emails or specific email content which is relevant

### Risks mitigation:
Test the Travel Email Discovery logic regularly using test emails and correct the logic where needed
