# Security Decision Record
## Partner API Security
Date: 16.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## SDR ID
SDR004

## SDR Version
1.0 - 16.09.2023

## Context
Security for the API's for partners should ensure that these are not shared or copied for unauthorized use

## Decision
The API Management for partner APIs must contain security measures to avoid unauthorized use by using the following API configuration
- Onboarding of partners by means of a formal registration process
- Creating a unique API Key and secret pair for each partner
- Creating a unique service account for each partner
- Adding the partners ip address to the Road Warrios API Management IP Allow list

## Consequences
This ensures that the Road Warrior's API's are only available to formally onboarded partners

### Positive:
- API's are only used for its intended purpose by authorized partners

### Negative:
- The partner onboarding requires specific configuration and adds complexity

### Risks:
- Additional work for the Road Warriors team to onboard and maintain partner connectivity

### Risks mitigation:
- proper documentation and guidance for all involved in the partner onboarding process
