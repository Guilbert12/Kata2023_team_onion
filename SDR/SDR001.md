# Security Decision Record
## Data storage and processing security
Date: 16.09.2023

## Status
Accepted

## SDR ID
SDR001 

## SDR Version
1.0 - 16.09.2023

## Context
Data storage and processing in this project must be done in a predictable, cohesive, compliant and understandable manner.

## Decision
Data should only be stored in the infrastructue if the following conditions are met
- The user has given specific consent for the processing and storage of the data (types) provided before using the Road Warrior
- Data processing and storage should be alligned with relevant, applicable laws & regulations

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Compliance is guarenteed, no room for doubt which data is used and how it's processed or stored
- Maintaining high privacy standards ensures trust from the user base and will yield a positive attitude towards the Road Warrior

### Negative:
- A defenition/register of all data types must be created and maintained
- Data retention routines, data storage and data processing should be audited which will add complexity to the solution

### Risks:
- The data defenition/register is not maintained properly and outdated

### Risks mitigation:
- For each development cycle the data defenition/register should be updated as part of the sprint activities
